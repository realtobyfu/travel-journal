## Introduction

This is a travel journal that is implemented in React.js using Vite.
It is built ground up following a given [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/Jk9STx5aMuLdNSls1WdStq/Travel-Journal-(Copy)?t=smETjE0OwJb0ZeEX-0) to test my skills with props and custom CSS.

The photos from the original design have been replaced because they can no logner be located

## Features

Each of the cards is populated from the data using props.
